version 2.0.0
- added a very basic GUI system. prone to errors i assume. just follow the the Example txt file i left in the repo




version 1.0.0

- you are going to need to edit the driver.cpp file and enter the adress of the input and output text files
- you are also going to need visual studio to edit and run the files since i didnt create a runnable exe (yet)
